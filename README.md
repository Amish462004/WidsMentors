This project revolves around the Basics of Options Theory and one of the most elementary equation in it but the king "The Black Scholes" equation which has some inherent assumptions for volatility and risk-free interest rate, which makes it go a little haywire in modern day context, thus, here we will be using the power of Deep Learning and Neural Networks to get rid of these assumptions and constraints and build a much superior model out of it.
We will certainly build MLP1,MLP2 and the LSTM model ,which
take 20-day historical volatility as an input, while the LSTM model takes in the
latest 20 days of underlying price, allowing it to learn volatility.
At the end of the learning phase the mentees, while doing the project would be able to extract the relevant data from the source and filter and prepare it for applying the relevant models on it.
